            Norwegian Wood (ノルウェイの森 - Noruwei No Mori)
            is a 1987 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami.
            The novel is a nostalgic story of loss. It is told
            from the first-person perspective of Toru Watanabe,
            who looks back on his days as a college student living
            in Tokyo. Through Watanabe's reminiscences, readers see
            him develop relationships with two very different women
            - the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the
            outgoing, lively Midori. This novel is set in late 1960s
            Tokyo during a period when Japanese students, like those
            of many other nations, were protesting against.
